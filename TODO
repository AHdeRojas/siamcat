BUG FIXES

N-DONE: - fix precision recall curves
N-DONE: - fix positioning of Adj. P-value in association plot
- make class weights adjustable in lasso_trainer
- fix ROC CI polygon drawing (looks weird for steep curves such as HMP oral)
- results_dir should be unique to a specific SIAMCAT run to avoid overwritten files
- data_validator cannot be found if master isn't run in the source directory (ignoring cfg's sourcedir)
- holdout validation is not possible without a label file -> FIX!!!
- also in holdout master src should be copied FIRST!
- get rid of $PREPARE in holdout master for consistency with cv master
- in data_validator.r add
   if (!is.null(fn.in.meta)) { [...]  m = match(names(label), rownames(meta.data))  meta.data = meta.data[m,,drop=F]

SOFTWARE REDESIGN

N-DONE: - visualization functions & model_interpretor redesign
N: - code for assigning fold IDs (cross validation) should be in a function that is call in lasso.r and in the data splitter
N: - all ROC curves should be generated using the pROC package (assoc. check & lasso predictor)
G: - code restyling (e.g. replace '=' by '<-')
N/G: - code refactoring to have an R package as well
- better data validator checks, space trimming and error messages
- automatic generation of labels from larger metadata sheets
- better model / label header checks

- use planemo, lint etc for Galaxy interface
- add documentation to Galaxy interface
- copy stuff on Galaxy server to local dir to be able to unmount all /g/bork...

- include in a docker container


TESTING / REPRODUCTION

N: - add a testing framework (in R)
N-DONE: - check whether labels other than -1 / +1 work
N: - check whether it works with raw abundances as input to data validator
  (test whether they are indeed converted to rel. ab. when corresponding options are set)
N: - rerun the whole CRC analysis to *reproduce* key figures
  (what's still missing is an heatmap display, see issue, 
  and partially the holdout test functionality).
N-DONE: - add options to model_interpretor to plot CRC heatmap
N: - use/convert other types of feature tables from LOTUS / RDP / UTAX etc

- test on all CRC data sets
- holdout testing framework (test with CRC data sets and automate meta-analysis)

NEW FEATURES

N-DONE: - more flexible plotting in association checks (box plots, shaded bars, bean)
N: - inclusion of other linear modeling methods (like in Jupyter notebook, explore caret packages)
N?: - inclusion of RF with a new model interpretor

- add some sort of structural separation check (PCoA) in addition to the association check
- feature selections (caret package? mRMRe, ..)
