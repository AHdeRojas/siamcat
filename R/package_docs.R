#' SIAMCAT is a pipeline for Statistical Inference of Associations between
#'  Microbial Communities And host phenoTypes. A primary goal of analyzing
#'  microbiome data is to determine changes in community composition that 
#'  are associated with environmental factors. In particular, linking human 
#'  microbiome composition to host phenotypes such as diseases has become an 
#'  area of intense research. For this, robust statistical modeling and 
#'  biomarker extraction toolkits are crucially needed.
